        Yup, I’m hankering on about Italy again! Honestly, I just can’t help it, it’s one of my favourite countries in
        the world to visit. Now, if you’re anything like me, you’ll love how diverse Italy is. In lots of ways, the
        North feels so different from the south, which can actually feel like a totally different country (but somehow,
        still surprises me). Even the Italian language sounds so different, but that’s just one of the things that makes
        gorgeous cities such as Milan, regions such as Cinque Terre and places like Rome feel so different and totally
        special.

        Now, if you’re hankering for a little bit of sunshine and that gorgeous Italian charm, then you’ve gotta visit
        some of the beautiful towns in Southern Italy.

        The south of Italy is known in Italian as the ‘Mezzogiorno’ or ‘Midday’ region and has some of the oldest and
        most important historical towns in Italy as well as some of the most epic beaches (that’s perfect for a chillout
        day).
