<h2>Poglavlje o Mozzaru</h2>
The quarrel with Colloredo was more difficult for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he
would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart's father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him
to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in
Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his
father's demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart's resignation as a "revolutionary step" that significantly
altered the course of his life.

    Emperor with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781,[50] and he soon "had established himself as the finest keyboard
    player in Vienna".[50] He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera Die Entführung aus dem
    Serail ("The Abduction from the Seraglio"), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The
    work was soon being performed "throughout German-speaking Europe",[50] and thoroughly established Mozart's
    reputation as a composer.

    Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from
    Mannheim. The family's father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet</p>

    After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange, Mozart's
    interest shifted to the third daughter of the family, Constanze.

    The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly
    broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her
    calves in a parlour game).[53] Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his
    father, Leopold.[54]

    The marriage took place in an atmosphere of crisis. Daniel Heartz suggests that eventually, Constanze moved in with
    Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time.[55] Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July
    1782, "All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already
    gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question."[55] Heartz relates, "Constanze's sister
    Sophie had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home
    [presumably from Mozart's apartment]."[55] On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldstätten, asking: "Can the
    police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If
    not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today."[55]

    The couple were finally married on 4 August 1782 in St. Stephen's Cathedral, the day before his father's consenting
    letter arrived in the mail. In the marriage contract, Constanze "assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which
    ... the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden", with the total "to pass to the survivor". Further,
    all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both.[
